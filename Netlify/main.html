            <h1>Hey there!</h1>
            <p>
                I’m currently a 4th-year Computer Science student at West Visayas State University - Main Campus, specializing in Artificial Intelligence. While my academic focus is deeply rooted in AI, I’ve developed a passion for crafting seamless and visually engaging user experiences through UI/UX design and web development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Living in Victorias City, I draw inspiration from the everyday challenges and opportunities around me, which fuel my desire to create meaningful solutions through technology. My journey in computer science revolves around blending innovation with creativity, whether it's designing intuitive web applications or exploring the endless possibilities of AI-driven systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond academics, I thrive on collaboration and enjoy connecting with like-minded individuals who share the same enthusiasm for impactful tech. I'm always eager to learn and grow, whether it’s diving into the latest design trends, exploring new frameworks, or contributing to projects that challenge my skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you’re interested in discovering more about my work, feel free to reach out or explore my portfolio. I’d love to share insights into my projects, from dynamic web applications to AI-powered solutions designed to make life just a little bit easier.

                Let’s build something incredible together!
